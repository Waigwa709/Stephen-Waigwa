My journey into software development started with a simple passion, the desire to build and create. Growing up, I had no digital skills and little exposure to technology, but I was fascinated by how websites and apps worked behind the scenes. That curiosity turned into a calling. Through self-teaching, perseverance, and faith, I began crafting digital solutions from the ground up. Every challenge I faced became a stepping stone, and every line of code a reflection of growth. Today, I code not just to build, but to impact, solve problems, and serve a greater purpose through technology.

I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and frameworks like React and Vue.js to craft beautiful, responsive interfaces. On the back-end, I work with PHP (Laravel), MySQL, and JavaScript-based technologies like Node.js and Express to build fast, scalable server-side applications. I now work as a full-stack software developer, building complete solutions including eCommerce platforms, custom CRM systems, business websites, and many more, all tailored to meet real business needs with scalability, performance, and user experience at the core. I'm also the founder of Kendrick Designs, where I apply my skills as a software developer, digital marketer, and graphic designer to help businesses grow in the digital space. I'm continuously learning, experimenting, and building real-world projects that bring value to users. My work is driven by faith, purpose, and a passion for excellence, and I believe that with the right mindset and skills, we can build solutions that truly make a difference.
